    "Lab exercises in the first part of this unit (\"Data Science\") were designed on Python having the __pandas__, __numpy__, __matplotlib__ and __sklearn__ packages installed. It is possible that for some commands you need to have the latest version of these packages/libraries installed on your machine. \n",
    "Finally, it is likely that you are new to some of the packages/commands/objects/data structures used for solving the lab excersies. In this case it is recommended to search for the documentations of these on the corresponding package's (e.g. numpy, pandas etc) website to familiarise yourself with these commands. An nice introduction to the basics of using the above Python packages (in the form of Jupyter notebooks) are also included in this online, free book which is highly recommended to look if you're new to them: https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook.\n",

    "To access entries of each column you can either use their column index number or the column's name in the table. Assume you want to access the table's column about the journey outcome, i.e. the variable ```Survived```, and put it in a new variable ```y```. Then using the column name you can run ```y = T['Survived']``` or ```y = T.Survived```. Alternatively, since Survived is the first columns of this table, you can access it via column indexing using ```iloc``` i.e. ```y = T.iloc[:,0]```. You can also do slicing i.e. ```y = T.iloc[:,[0,1]]``` would extract the first 2 columns of this table. The output will be another table object because the columns could potentially have mixed variable types (numerical, strings etc). If all columns are numerical values, then you can turn ```y``` into a matrix using ```to_numpy()``` command i.e. ```y = T.iloc[:,[0,1]].to_numpy()```. (More details on data type conversion commands can be found at: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/indexing.html). Similarly, ```y = T.iloc[:,3:-1].to_numpy()``` would extract columns 4 and onward till the end, into a matrix y. Row indexing is also possible. For instance, ```y = T.iloc([0, 4, 5],:)``` would extract table rows 1 5 and 6 into a new sub-table."
